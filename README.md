# Store sales analysis
The primary objective of any store's sales and profit analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of its retail performance. This involves a systematic examination of sales and profit data over a specified time period, typically involving variables such as time-period, sales figures, product information, pricing details, and customer data.

To successfully achieve this objective, the ideal dataset should encompass these critical variables. In pursuit of this goal, the project team identified the "Adidas US Sales" dataset on Kaggle as an ideal resource. The dataset not only aligns perfectly with the project's requirements but also offers a rich pool of data for analysis.

The project encompasses a series of crucial steps, starting with data cleaning to ensure data accuracy and reliability. It then progresses to data visualization, using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly, to effectively communicate key insights and trends. The final phase involves an in-depth analysis of the dataset, drawing actionable conclusions to improve store performance, enhance sales strategies, and optimize profitability.
