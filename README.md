# Store sales analysis
The aim of any store sales and profit analysis is to enhance and understand the performance of any retail store by analysing its sales and profit. And for that we needed a dataset which had the following variables- time-period, sales, product, pricing and customer data. In addition to which, I discovered that Adidas US Sales on Kaggle satisfies ( the project's objective).

This project includes data cleaning, visualisation and analysis. 

Libraries used : Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly
